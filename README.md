## MLB Opener Strategy Analysis Project Description

In our project, we analyze the "Opener" Strategy in the Major League Baseball. My groupmates
and I determine if the "Opener strategy" is significant compared to the traditional starting pitcher strategy. If the "Opener" strategy
is significant, we want to find the significant factors of this strategy. Our motivation comes from a [Sports Illustrated Article](https://www.si.com/mlb/2018/08/23/tampa-bay-rays-bullpen).
